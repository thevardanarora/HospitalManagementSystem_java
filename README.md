This project is a Hospital Management System built using Java and MySQL. The goal is to create a system that manages hospital operations, such as adding patients, viewing patient and doctor information, and booking appointments.

Key Features:

Patient Management: Add new patients and view existing patient records.

Doctor Management: View the list of doctors available in the hospital.

Appointment Booking: Schedule appointments between patients and doctors, ensuring the doctor's availability on the chosen date.

Database Connectivity: Uses JDBC to connect and interact with a MySQL database.

The structure includes classes for handling patients and doctors and a main class that manages user input and overall system operations. It's a solid starting point for developing a comprehensive hospital management system. Nice work!
